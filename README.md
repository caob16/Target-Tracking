# Target-Tracking

This repository documents an innovative project where the frame difference technique is applied to accurately identify and extract contours of moving objects within video streams. The project aims to tackle common challenges in motion detection, such as multiple contour formation and internal object hollows, by employing morphological operations like erosion and dilation.

Key elements of the project include:

-Utilizing the frame difference method to pinpoint dynamic objects against static backgrounds.

-Refining contour extraction through morphological transformations, ensuring a more cohesive and accurate representation of moving entities.

-Enhancing object detection precision by binarizing foreground regions, effectively separating targets from noise.

-Implementing histogram projection to further sharpen target recognition, leading to clearer and more distinct detection outcomes.
